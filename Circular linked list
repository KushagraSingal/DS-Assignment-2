/* [Question.1] While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first element? */

//[Ans.1]
//Lets take an example and create a basic circular linked list
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//Creating Node class
class Node{
    //Creating class objects
    public:
    int data;
    Node*next;
    //Calling Node constructor
    Node(int data){
        this->data=data;
        next=NULL;
    }
};
//Function to insert a node at end on linked list
void append(Node*&head,int data){
    Node*temp=head;
    Node*new_node=new Node(data);
    if(temp==NULL){head=new_node;new_node->next=head;return;}
    while(temp->next!=head){temp=temp->next;}   //This condition establishes that the traversing element(temp) has reached the first element
    temp->next=new_node;
    new_node->next=head;
}
//Function to print elements of linked list from head to the last node.
void pfun(Node*&head){
    Node*temp=head;
    do{cout<<temp->data<<"->";temp=temp->next;}
    while(temp!=head);
}

int main(){
    Node*head=NULL;
    append(head,1);
    append(head,2);
    append(head,3);
    pfun(head);
}
/*
With reference to above example of circular linked list.
Line 24 i.e. while(temp->next!=head){temp=temp->next;} establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first element.
We Know that in circular linked list last node of linked list points to head of that linked list, hence we can check if any node points to head of linked list then that node is the end of circular linked list.

/*[Question.2]  What are the practical applications of a circular linked list? (Try to find applications in your respective fields).
Practical applications of circular linked list are :
1 Applications that require a looped, one-by-one access to the complete list use circular lists.
2 The operating system uses a Round-Robin time-sharing technique to divide up the available time among its users.
3 Games with several players switch between them in a loop using a circular list.
4 Implementation of advanced data structures, such as the Fibonacci Heap
5 Using the BACK button is made possible by the browser's cache.
